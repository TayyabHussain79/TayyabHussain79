🎯 **About Me**

I’m currently working as an **AI Engineer**, where I focus on building intelligent systems at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Generative AI**, and **Agentic AI**. My work involves developing real-time, vision-driven applications and multi-agent architectures that automate decision-making, enhance enterprise workflows, and generate contextual, human-like responses and content.

I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science**, where I built a strong foundation in **Deep Learning**, **Machine Learning**, and **Visual Recognition**. My academic focus on **Computer Vision** led me to develop a **real-time hand gesture digit recognizer** using **CNN** and **OpenCV**, which fueled my passion for building intuitive, vision-driven interfaces.

In my current role, I design and deploy advanced AI solutions using tools like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, **CrewAI**, **SmolAgent**, and **FastAPI**. I specialize in crafting **multi-agent systems**, **RAG-based pipelines**, and **LLM-integrated architectures** that seamlessly process, reason over, and generate both visual and textual data. Some of the key projects I’ve contributed to include **SmartMail AI**, **AI PDF Assistants**, and **SecureRAG**, each integrating elements of **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, and autonomous agent collaboration.

My long-term vision is to bridge the gap between **visual understanding** and **intelligent automation** by building AI agents that can not only see but also think and act. I'm particularly interested in areas like **video understanding**, **gesture-based interaction**, **vision-language models**, and **autonomous multi-agent systems**.
